# Gold-Price-Forecasting-with-LSTM-Price-vs-Log-Return-vs-10-Day-Log-Return
This project explores LSTM-based gold price forecasting using three target formulations: raw price, 1-day log return, and 10-day log return. It demonstrates how non-stationarity affects deep learning models and how multi-horizon log returns improve stability and trend capture in financial time series.
